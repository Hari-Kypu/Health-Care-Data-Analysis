# Health-Care-Data-Analysis

To enhance operational efficiency and provide actionable insights into emergency room performance, we need to create a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Power BI. This solution will enable stakeholders to track, analyze, and make data-driven decisions regarding patient management and service optimization.


### Dashboard 1: Monthly View 
Objective: Monitor key metrics and trends on a month-by-month basis to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
Charts:
Patient Admission Status: Track admitted vs. non-admitted patients.
Patient Age Distribution: Group patients by 10-year age intervals.
Department Referrals: Analyze referral trends across different departments.
Timeliness: Measure the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.
Gender Analysis: Visualize patient distribution by gender.
Racial Demographics: Analyze patient data by race.
Time Analysis: Assess patient volume by day and hour.

### Dashboard 2: Consolidated View 
Objective: Provide a holistic summary of hospital performance for a selected date range.
Charts:
Similar metrics as the Monthly View, but aggregated over a customizable date range for broader insights and trend analysis

### Dashboard 3: Patient Details
Objective: Offer granular insights into patient-level data to enable detailed analysis and troubleshooting.
Charts: A grid displaying essential fields:
Patient ID
Patient Full Name
Gender
Age
Admission Date
Patient Race
Wait Time
Department Referral
Admission Status

### Dashboard 4: Consolidated View 
Objective: Summarize the findings from all dashboards to provide clear and actionable insights for stakeholders.
Charts:
Descriptive analysis of each metric and visualization, including patterns, anomalies, and actionable recommendations to optimize emergency room operations and patient care.
